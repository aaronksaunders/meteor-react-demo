#Demo Using React & Meteor

###Overview
* This is based on the code from the starter video and template provided by [https://github.com/ryanswapp/react-meteor-template](https://github.com/ryanswapp/react-meteor-template). 
* Link to youtube video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVbVBp35keQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVbVBp35keQ)

###Differences
* There was some code missing that showed how to actually create an account so I have included that in this demo.
* The form helper code did not properly use the label when rendering the form
* The form helper code did not support a date picker - used package [3stack:react-datetimepicker](https://atmospherejs.com/3stack/react-datetimepicker)
* The form helper code did not support select-option input type
